The OAuth2 Redirect URI is the location where the provider will redirect to after trying to login. This needs to set to your Postiz `FRONTEND_URL` + `/integrations/social/` + `providername`.

* eg: If your Postiz URL is: `https://postiz.example.com`, then your OAuth2 Redirect URI is `https://postiz.example.com/integrations/social/`.
* eg: If your Postiz URL is `https://localhost:5000`, then your OAuth2 Redirect URI is `https://localhost:5000/integrations/social/providername`.

You only need to set one OAuth2 Redirect URI when you are setting up your Postiz app.
